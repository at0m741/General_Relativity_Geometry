# Schwarzschild Metric and Tensor Calculations

This project implements numerical calculations based on the Schwarzschild metric using finite difference methods. It includes C-based functions for calculating various tensors like the Christoffel symbols, the Riemann tensor, the Ricci tensor, and the Kretschmann scalar. These computations allow for a detailed analysis of the curvature properties around a black hole in general relativity.

Key components include metric evaluation, Christoffel symbol computation, and tensor contraction for curvature calculations.
